***Direct connect to an internal host inside GCP:

In order to connect to an internal host through Bastion-host we can use following one line syntax:

   ssh -i <local path to your ssh secret key> -A -t <your user name>@<bastion-host public ip> 'ssh <internal host name>'

"-A" switch stands for forwarding of the authentication agent
"-t" switch stands for pseudo-terminal allocation

Or we can use ssh ProxyCommand feature:

We should create ssh "config" file in our home directory "~/.ssh/" with appropriate permissions (0600 would be enough) and following content:

   Host <alias for our internal host>
   ProxyCommand ssh <bastion-host public ip> -W %h:%p

bastion_IP = 35.234.123.137
someinternalhost_IP = 10.156.0.3
